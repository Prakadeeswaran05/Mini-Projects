This project uses temeperature,co2 level,humidity and light data to detect the presence of a human being in the room using Machine Learning. I have used LinearSVC and RandomForestClassifier models.




The test accuracy in RandomForestClassifier is 0.99 and for LinearSVC it is 0.98




The data set is got from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+ UC Irvine
